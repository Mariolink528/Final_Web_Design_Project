            <h2>Weapon Details</h2>

            <p> 
                Weapons are equipped to adventurers to increase their stats. 
                There are 9 different types of weapons currently in the game, each being usable by certain characters. 
                Swords, Blades, Daggers, Lances and Axes are used for close quarters combat, with the player staying close to the enemies. 
                Bows, Staffs, Wands and Manacasters are used from a distance, though they don't have infinite range. 
                Each weapon type has one of each element available at each power level, except for manacasters. 
                Manacasters still aren't available for the wind element, as they are relatively new, and a wind manacaster hasn't been released at the time of writing this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each weapon has unique properties, like the type of skills a character has, the attack speed, the attack range, and the force strike a character can use.
                Axes for example have a force strike that draws in nearby enemies and hits in a circle, while swords have a forward lunging force strike.
                Manacasters have three different modes that a character can use them in, each with a different attack range, damage and more. 
                Staff users also are the only healer units in the game, with skills that focus on healing and buffing. 
                I'd reccomend trying each weapon out in the Alberian Battle Royale mode and focus on whichever feels the best to use. 
                Keep in mind that the only manacaster mode in the Battle Royale mode is rapid fire. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else you should keep in mind is that each weapon type has a different coability that the characters use.
                Coabilities are buffs affect the entire party, but two of the same type don't stack. 
                The coabilities tend to focus on buffs to the weapon it comes from, like with the sword coability buffing strength. 
                For that reason it's usually a good idea to have the team be from different weapon types. 
                There are some exceptions to that though, like Gala Euden having one that focuses on dragon form, or Megaman focusing on the overdrive bar.

            <h2>Obtaining Weapons</h2>
            <img src = "https://dragalialost.akamaized.net/attached/information/images/fe9e2b6e2135f25195bc59f9ab53b8e9.png" alt = "High Dragon Screen">
            <p>
                Unlike adventurers and dragons, weapons can only be obtained through crafting. 
                To craft weapons, first you have to have upgraded your smithy facility to a high enough level, but that part will be mentioned on the <a href = "WyrmFacil.html">Facilities Page.</a>
                Once unlocked, a weapon can be crafted by using materials like fiend parts, elemental materials, and stardust. 
                They can then be leveled up using whetstones, as well as further upgraded with more materials. 
                There's also the option to add an additional wyrmprint slot, make additional copies, or permanently buff adventurers that use that weapon type.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early on, you'll start out trying to forge and upgrade the core weapons, the first ones added to the game. 
                After that is probably the most complicated part of upgrading, the void weapons. 
                Before the 2.0 update, you had to make at least five different void weapons on the way, with a huge tangled mess on how to upgrade each. 
                Now, it's one void weapon that gets gradually upgraded to give different resistances to users of the weapon type. 
                The specifics are different for each weapon, but the flow is to start with a void enemy without a debuff that can be inflicted, and move from there based on what you now resist. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After going through the mess that was the void system, you'll arrive at two different available fights: the chimeras and the void dragons. 
                Fighting void dragons buffs your damage against the Advanced High Dragons, while defeating the chimeras unlocks Chimeratech weapons. 
                Forging a chimeratech weapon also has the bonus of unlocking the Agito fights, the source of the best weapons in the game. 
                The advanced high dragon trials give High Dragon weapons, the second best in the game. 
                While it is possible to defeat the Agito with chimeratech weapons, some still get the High Dragon weapons for the extra damage. 
                It's all a matter of if you're confident enough to beat them without the High Dragon weapons.
