                    <p> Adventurers are the characters that you play as, and are the ones that everything is equipped to.
                        Choosing the adventurer used is probably the most important choice. 
                        Each team can have up to four adventurers, each with their own dragons, wyrmprints and weapons. 
                        The adventurers are typically categorized by their weapon and element, but each have unique skills to make them different.

                    <h3>Weapons</h3>

                    <p> 
                        Weapons are equipped to adventurers to increase their stats. 
                        There are 9 different types of weapons currently in the game, each being usable by certain characters. 
                        Swords, Blades, Daggers, Lances and Axes are used for close quarters combat, with the player staying close to the enemies. 
                        Bows, Staffs, Wands and Manacasters are used from a distance, though they don't have infinite range. 
                        Each weapon type has one of each element available at each power level, except for manacasters. 
                        Manacasters still aren't available for the wind element, as they are relatively new, and a wind manacaster hasn't been released at the time of writing this.

                <h3>Wyrmprints and Facilities</h3>
                <figure class = "highlight">
                    <img src = "Images/Wyrmprint.png" alt = "Wyrmprint Example">

                <p>
                    Wyrmprints are cards with an ability and some small stat boosts. 
                    They are technically equipped on weapons, but that's usually not that important. 
                    Weapons by default have 2 slots for 5 star Wyrmprints and 2 for 4 star wyrmprints, but most have the ability to unlock a 3rd 5 star slot.
                    They can all be equipped by all adventurers, but some only affect certain ones, and others don't synergize well. 
                    For example, it's a pretty bad idea to give an adventurer without healing skills a wyrmprint that buffs healing.
